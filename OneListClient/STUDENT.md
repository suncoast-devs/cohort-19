## To push to github

If you selected `Y` during `dotnet new` you can add your changes and push to github with:

1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m "Here I describe my changes"`
1. `git push`

Otherwise do the following _ONCE_ before using the steps above.

1. `git init`
1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m "Initial Commit"`
1. `hub create`
1. `git push -u origin master`

## PROTIP:

When you are complete with the project and have turned it in to your instructor, update README.md with details about the assignment.
