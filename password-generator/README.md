# Password Generator

Today's warmup: Create a password generator to help you make better passwords!

- Your application should have a slider that ranges from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 64
- Your application should have a text area to display the generated password
- As the user moves the slider you should update the text element with a randomly created password, of the length specified by the slider, comprised of lowercase, uppercase, and digits.
  - const passwordCharacters = ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z","A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z","0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"]
- Hint: write a function that takes the number of characters as an argument and returns a random password? Start with that and then use that within your application. Treat this as a coding challenge itself (maybe with PEDAC)
